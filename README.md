# Sky-logger-1
A homemade high-altitude rocket project that collects, visualizes, and analyzes flight telemetry data. Includes real-time tracking of altitude, velocity, and other sensor metrics, along with detailed graphs and charts for post-flight analysis. Built for learning, experimentation, and hands on aerospace exploration.

Also since i got alotttt of school to do this project might take like 3-6 months and updates might take a while
